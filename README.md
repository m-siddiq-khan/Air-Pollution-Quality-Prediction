# Air-pollution-Quality-Prediction

# Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting air pollution quality using various machine learning models. By historical air quality data, the goal is to build predictive models that can accurately estimate pollution levels based on environmental factors. The project involves data collection, preprocessing, model implementation, and performance evaluation.

# Features

Data Collection: Gathered comprehensive air quality data from Kaggle, which includes various pollutants and atmospheric conditions.

Data Preprocessing: Utilized Pandas for data cleaning and normalization to handle missing values, outliers, and ensure data is in a suitable format for modeling.
